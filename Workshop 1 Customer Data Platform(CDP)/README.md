# Customer Data Platform (CDP) Design

## What is CDP?

A Customer Data Platform (CDP) is **a specialized software system that centralizes and unifies customer data from various sources to create a single, comprehensive customer profile**. CDPs enable businesses to collect, integrate, and manage customer information, offering real-time updates, segmentation, analytics, and integration with marketing tools. They facilitate personalized marketing, improve customer engagement, ensure data compliance, and help organizations make data-driven decisions, ultimately enhancing customer relationships and driving revenue growth by leveraging the power of unified customer data.

## Why Central Group?

Central Group is a Thai multinational conglomerate consisting of subsidiaries in retail, property development, brand management, hospitality, and food and beverage sectors. It has a lot of room for potential use cases and improvement. This is why I gathered possible data sources and made some use cases out of it.
